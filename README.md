## Dynamic ISF

Dynamic ISF uses Chris WIlson's model to determine ISF instead of a static profile settings. This is applied only in the openAPSSMB plugin. The openAPSAMA plugin continues to use profile settings for ISF.

The equation implemented is: ISF = 277700 / BG * TDD

The implementation here splits the use into two. One to calculate current ISF for use with predictions, the other to calculate future ISF for use with dosing. 

**Current ISF**

This uses a combination of the 7 day average TDD and a linear extrapolation of the pumps current total insulin delivered to calculate a TDD for today.

The total daily dose used in the above equation is generally weighted 40% to the 7 day average and 60% to the extrapolation from the pump data. There are some special cases where this isn't applied. These are:

* *When the time is earlier than 5am and the pump TDD is greater than 7 day TDD*
* *When the time is earlier than 7am and the pump TDD is less than 80% of 7 day TDD*

In both these cases, a value of 80% of TDD is used in the caluclation.

*When the pump TDD is less than 33% of 7 day TDD*

In this case, the weighting is changed to be 75% pump TDD, 25% 7 day average TDD.

The dynamic ISF value is still adjusted when setting an activity or eating soon temp target, as per the standard oref model.

**Future ISF**

Future ISF uses the same TDD value as generated above. It then uses different glucose values dependent on the case:

If delta is +ve or zero, or delta is negative but predicted glucose is above target, the future ISF value used for determining insulin required is the same as the current ISF.

If delta is -ve, and the predicted glucose level is below target, then the future ISF value is used, as this is a less aggressive value.
